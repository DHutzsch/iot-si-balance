# IoT SI Scale






## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Arduino IDE 2.3.2 with Arduino Mbed OS RP2040 Boards version 4.1.4, DHT sensor library by Adafruit version 1.4.6, 
HX711 Arduino library by Bogdan Necula version 0.7.5.

## Usage
Please, refer to the Wiki.

## Support
Documentation in this Git project and in the source code is the only available support.
